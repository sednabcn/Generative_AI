Maximum Petal Width found in the dataset,MAX(Petal Width)
Group records by Species,GROUP BY(Species)
Sort the entries by Sepal Length in ascending order,ORDER BY(Sepal Length ASC)
List Species alphabetically,ORDER BY(Species ASC)
Entries with Sepal Length at least 5.0,Sepal Length >= 5.0
Entries with Petal Length between 1.5 and 2.5,Petal Length BETWEEN 1.5 AND 2.5
Top 3 entries with the highest Sepal Width,TOP 3 BY(Sepal Width DESC)
Species is 'Setosa',Species = 'Setosa'
Species starts with 'Se',Species STARTS WITH 'Se'
Calculate the total of Petal Lengths, SUM([Petal Length])
What is the average Petal Width?, AVG([Petal Width])
Determine the middle value of Sepal Widths,MEDIAN([Sepal Width])
How many data points are there?,COUNT([Sepal Length])
Number of unique flower types,COUNTD([Species])
Lowest Sepal Length recorded,MIN([Sepal Length])
Highest value of Petal Width found,MAX([Petal Width])
Organize data by Species in descending order,"SORT([Species], DESC)"
Rank Sepal Lengths from low to high,"SORT([Sepal Length], ASC)"
Filter for Sepal Length greater than or equal to 4.5,[Sepal Length] >= 4.5
Select entries with Petal Width less than 2.0,[Petal Width] < 2.0
Show entries where Sepal Width is not 3.0,[Sepal Width] != 3.0
List all where the Species name ends with 'ica',"ENDSWITH([Species], ""ica"")"
Entries with a Sepal Length of exactly 5.0,[Sepal Length] = 5.0
Display the top 5 Species by Sepal Width, INDEX() <= 5 SORT BY SUM([Sepal Width]) DESC
Find the 3 smallest Petal Lengths, INDEX() <= 3 SORT BY [Petal Length] ASC
Count occurrences where Petal Length is between 4 and 5,IF [Petal Length] >= 4 AND [Petal Length] <= 5 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
Aggregate data by the month of observation (assuming there's a Date field),"DATETRUNC('month', [Date])"
Filter records from last year (assuming there's a Date field),YEAR([Date]) = YEAR(TODAY()) - 1
Show only the data starting from January this year,"[Date] >= DATETRUNC('year' , TODAY())"
"Find the average Sepal Length for each Species, sorted alphabetically", AVG([Sepal Length]) GROUP BY [Species] SORT BY [Species] ASC
Count how many Species start with 'C', COUNTD(IF LEFT([Species], 1) = 'C' THEN [Species] ELSE NULL END)
Entries with Petal Length and Sepal Length both above 4.0, [Petal Length] > 4.0 AND [Sepal Length] > 4.0
List Species with Petal Width in the top 10%, RANK_PERCENTILE([Petal Width]) <= 0.1

Total number of records grouped by Species, sorted by Species alphabetically, COUNT([Species]) GROUP BY [Species] ORDER BY [Species] ASC
Filter to show only Iris versicolor with Sepal Width at least 3.0,"[Species] = ""versicolor"" AND [Sepal Width] >= 3.0"
Show top 5 Sepal Lengths within Iris virginica only,"RANK([Sepal Length]) <= 5 AND [Species] = ""virginica"""
Iris flowers with Petal Width in the bottom 10th percentile,RANK_PERCENTILE([Petal Width]) >= 0.9
Average Sepal Length for each species, listed from highest to lowest, AVG([Sepal Length]) GROUP BY [Species] ORDER BY AVG([Sepal Length]) DESC
Entries with Petal Length between 4.0 and 5.0 for Iris setosa,"[Species] = ""setosa"" AND [Petal Length] BETWEEN 4.0 AND 5.0"
Count Iris flowers where the Species name contains 'color',"SUM(IF CONTAINS([Species],""color"") THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)"
List all Iris flowers where the Species name starts with 'Iri' and ends with 'a'," STARTSWITH([Species], ""Iri"") AND ENDSWITH([Species], “a”)"
